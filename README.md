# Creating images of the distortion phantom model

For estimation of point spread function, distortion characterization etc

## Building

This uses ITK and tclap - the fetching and build is described in setup.sh

Clone this repo, change into the repo, run setup.sh

```
git clone https://github.com/richardbeare/DistortionPhantom

cd DistortionPhantom

bash ./setup.sh

```

This will produce an executable called `BuildLoadMesh/loadMesh`
